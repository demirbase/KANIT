# Upload and verification of a packed backup (scripts/backup.py pack; plan F3.5).
# Runs on a node with internet: on TRUBA the login node, outside the containers.
#
#   backup_upload.sh STAGE REMOTE RUN LEDGER
#
# One archive per rclone call: a short process is not killed for running long, and a
# failure costs one archive. An upload that fails or stalls is stopped and tried again, at
# most BACKUP_ATTEMPTS times (3); rclone skips a file that already arrived. An attempt may
# take BACKUP_MIN_SECONDS (600) plus 2 s per MB, what 0.5 MB/s needs: two uploads of the
# pilot stalled without an error on TRUBA's login node (2026-10-06), which uploaded at
# 1-10 MB/s. rclone reports its progress every 2 min. Then three checks against REMOTE/RUN:
#   1. the MD5 of every archive and of the manifest (rclone check, scoped to them);
#   2. no name twice (Google Drive allows two files with one name, and a retried upload
#      can make them);
#   3. the number of files.
# Only when all three pass are the manifest's rows added to the ledger, the ledger
# copied to REMOTE and the staged archives deleted. Otherwise it exits non-zero and
# leaves everything in place: a backup is never reported done without being checked.
# rclone exit 7 is Google Drive's daily upload cap: run the stage again the next day.
