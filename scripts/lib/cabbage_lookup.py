"""KANIT lookup on the external isolates (CABBAGE): the knowledge base used as a catalogue.

Added during the study (2026-11-13), next to the final models' predictions of §14 item 4; the
rule was fixed before any lookup result was computed.

A marker is a graded candidate pattern of a model, of grade ``weak`` or better (primary,
allele-aware mode), with the direction of its prevalence difference: ``R`` when it is more
frequent in the resistant genomes, ``S`` when in the susceptible ones. An isolate is called
resistant by a rule when it carries at least one ``R`` marker of the rule; a pattern is
present in an isolate when at least half of its member unitigs are (as for the models,
lib/cabbage_predict.PRESENT_SHARE).

Rules:
  upto_<grade>  the R markers graded <grade> or better (confirmed > strong_novel >
                candidate > weak)
  b1            the R markers concordant with a curated determinant (CARD state b),
                whatever their grade: the catalogue part of the knowledge base alone
  score         secondary: R markers present minus S markers present, all grades up to
                weak; a continuous score, read at > 0

The primary rule is chosen on the training genomes, before the external isolates are
looked at: the upto_ rule with the highest balanced accuracy over the pooled counts of
every model (a tie goes to the stricter rule).
